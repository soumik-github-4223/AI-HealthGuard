# About the Project

</div>


## Project Overview

The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a web-based application
that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms. By leveraging
advanced machine learning algorithms, it aims to assist users and
healthcare professionals in identifying potential health conditions.

## Core Features

-   Accurate predictions for multiple diseases like diabetes,
    cardiovascular conditions, and more.
-   User-friendly web interface accessible on various devices.
-   Integration of visualization tools for clear result representation.
-   Provides disease description, medications, precautions, and
    recommended workouts/diets.

## Technologies Used

-   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   Backend: Flask (Python)
-   Machine Learning: SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
-   Data Sources: Custom datasets containing symptoms, medications, and
    precautions


## How It Works

Users can input their symptoms through a responsive interface. The
system processes the input and predicts the most likely disease using
machine learning algorithms. It provides a detailed description of the
disease along with precautions, medications, workouts, and diets.
